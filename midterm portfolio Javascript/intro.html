        <br>
        <p>"Pretty girls weighing no more than 100, so fat and still eating?" "You are 30 years old and still not married?" "Every day, just stay home with the kids; why will you get tired?" "Sorry, this position may not be suitable for youâ€¦"  These sentences represent the potential requirements of society for women or girls, which bring invisible pressure on women and even make women doubt themselves. In today's society, stereotypes still influence women's lives, perhaps even by our closest parents: you should get married when you're old enough, women should take care of the whole family, and you should obey men's decisions... Women become isolated and sensitive inside when their parents also have this industrial rule. Nowadays, many men or women themselves take it for granted that a woman's weight should be around 45kg and her height around 170cm, which is a standard of beauty. The industrial aesthetic emotions are like an invisible shackle that places the charge of no crime on girls who fail to meet the potential social requirements. However, the world is so wonderful because of the existence of people of all colors, shapes, personalities, and appearances. Accept and love your truest self; you will have unlimited power and shine.</p>

        </h3>
<br>
        <p>The industrialization of social aesthetic emotions can lead to threats to women's mental health or health: low self-esteem (affecting daily life and school, even aspects of interpersonal communication), anorexia (a physical hazard, an eating disorder characterized by abnormally low weight, a severe fear of weight gain, and a distorted perception of weight. Patients with anorexia nervosa place an abnormal emphasis on weight and body image control, going to extreme lengths, often with serious life consequences). But so far, in recent years the mass social media still over-promotes the slim body shape in order to broadcast volume and attention to the heat to give up the dissemination of the correct values, making for the public misconception of the presentation of beauty only the mass media is purely in the industrialized beauty persona when the idea once implanted will think that beauty should be so, from then on the feeling of disappointment that they can not meet the aesthetic standards. I used to feel inferior because I saw a big difference between myself and the perfect persona advertised in the mass media, and I became very sensitive and even reluctant to meet new friends. During the period of low self-esteem, my life rhythm was disrupted, making me more and more anxious. Later, after a period of adjustment, I realized that only by accepting my imperfections can I be confident from the bottom of my heart and meet life with a better mindset. Life is very short; we can not live in the mouth of others, to be yourself is the most joyful thing in the world.
